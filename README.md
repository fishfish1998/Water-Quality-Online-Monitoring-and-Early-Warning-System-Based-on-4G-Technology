These are the upper commputer codes of our program. In this program, a remote intelligent water quality monitoring and early warning platform is designed to monitor the parameters of water such as temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and salinity remotely, which integrates the function of automatic water quality sampling and analysis, automatic detection and early warning. The control of monitoring cycle and start-stop of monitoring is achieved. And the automatic sampling function is provided if water is polluted.
